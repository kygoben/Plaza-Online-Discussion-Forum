## Starting Devlopment Server
To start the server, use `npm run start`  

`"npm"` tells the computer that this is `node package manager`, `run` tells the computer to look at the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file, and `start` tells it to run the script that is under start. In our case, there is a `webpack` script defiend there. If you want to know more about webpack, google it. This entire setup is from the [internet](https://dev.to/riddhiagrawal001/create-react-app-without-create-react-app-2lgd).

## CKEditor
This app uses `CKEditor`, an open source rich text editor. The link to the documentation can be found [here](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/frameworks/react.html).
